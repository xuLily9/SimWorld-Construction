# Overview

SimWorld consists of two parts:

1. Unreal Engine executable file.
2. Python package.

Connection between Python and UE is set up by UnrealCV+, which holds TCP client in Python and server in UE. In Python, it is structured as a `Communicator` Class. In UE, it is an embedded plugin.

Below shows the code structure of the Python Package.
