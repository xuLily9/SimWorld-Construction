## 💡 Introduction
SimWorld is built on Unreal Engine 5 and offers core capabilities to meet the needs of modern agent development. It provides:
- Realistic, open-ended world simulation with accurate physics and language-based procedural generation.
- Rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, supporting multi-modal perception and natural language actions.
- Diverse and customizable physical and social reasoning scenarios, enabling systematic training and evaluation of complex agent behaviors like navigation, planning, and strategic cooperation.

<a id="architecture"></a>
## 🏗️ Architecture
<p align="center">
    <img width="799" height="671" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e67356a-7dca-4eba-ab57-de1226e080bb" />
</p>

**SimWorld** consists of three layers:
- the Unreal Engine Backend, providing diverse and open-ended environments, rich assets and realistic physics simulation;
- the Environment layer, supporting procedural city generation, language-driven scene editing, gym-like APIs for LLM/VLM agents and traffic simulation;
- the Agent layer, enabling LLM/VLM agents to reason over multimodal observations and history while executing actions via a local action planner.

SimWorld's architecture is designed to be modular and flexible, supporting an array of functionalities such as dynamic world generation, agent control, and performance benchmarking. The components are seamlessly integrated to provide a robust platform for **Embodied AI** and **Agents** research and applications.

## 🚀 Quick Tour
Here's a minimal example showing how to create an LLM-driven navigation task in SimWorld. This demo creates a humanoid agent that autonomously navigates to a target location using natural language reasoning and a Gym-like interface.

Note that the code is simplified for demonstration. For the complete implementation, see [examples/gym_interface_demo.ipynb](examples/gym_interface_demo.ipynb). More examples are available in the [examples/](examples/) directory.

from simworld.utils.vector import Vector

# 1. Define Agent class - uses LLM to decide navigation actions
class Agent():
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = BaseLLM("gpt-4o")
        self.system_prompt = """ ... Your task is to ..."""

    def action(self, obs, target):
        position = obs['position']
        direction = obs['direction']

        # Calculate angle to target
        current_yaw = math.degrees(math.atan2(direction.y, direction.x))
        # ... calculate angle difference to target ...

        action, _ = self.llm.generate_text(system_prompt=self.system_prompt, user_prompt=prompt)
        return action.strip()

## ⚙️ Setup

This section walks through the minimal setup to run SimWorld using our provided UE packages and the Python client. If you want to use your own custom environments, assets, or agent models, you can import them via `.pak` files. See [Make Your SimWorld](#make-your-simworld) for instructions.

**System Requirements:** SimWorld requires Windows or Linux operating system, a dedicated GPU with ≥6GB VRAM, 32GB RAM, and 50-200GB disk space depending on the package. For detailed hardware requirements and recommendations, see the [Device Requirement](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html).


### Installation
#### Step 1. Install the Python Client

Make sure to use Python 3.10 or later.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld.git
cd SimWorld
conda create -n simworld python=3.10
conda activate simworld
pip install -e .
```

#### Step 2. Download the UE Server Package

First, download and extract the **Base** UE server package for your OS. The Base package includes two lightweight city scenes and one empty map for quickly testing SimWorld’s core features, including core agent interaction and procedural city generation.

<a id="base-package"></a>
- **Base (required, 2 city maps and 1 empty map)**
  - **Windows:** [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/blob/main/Base20260201/Windows.zip)
  - **Linux:** [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/blob/main/Base20260201/Linux.zip)

If you want more pre-built scenes for demos and diverse scenarios, you can optionally install **Additional Environments (100+ Maps)**. This is an add-on map pack that extends the Base installation. Download the maps you need and copy the `.pak` files into the Base server folder at:
`SimWorld/Content/Paks/`.

<a id="additional-environments"></a>
- **Additional Environments (optional, 100+ maps)**
  - **Windows:** [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/tree/main/AdditionEnvironmentPaks/Windows)
  - **Linux:** [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/tree/main/AdditionEnvironmentPaks/Linux)

The Additional Environments package is organized as separate `.pak` files, so you can download only the maps you need. Please check the [download and installation](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/additional_environments.html#download-and-installation) for usage instructions, including how to load specific maps and what each `.pak` contains.


<a id="quick-start"></a>
### Quick Start

We provide several examples of code in [examples/](examples/), showcasing how to use the basic functionalities of SimWorld, including city layout generation, traffic simulation, asset retrieval, and activity-to-actions. Please follow the examples to see how SimWorld works.

#### Start the UE Server
Start the SimWorld UE server first, then run the Python examples. From the extracted UE server package directory:

- **Windows:** double-click `SimWorld.exe`, or launch it from the command line:
  ```bash
  ./SimWorld.exe <MAP_PATH>
  ```

- **Linux:** run:
    ```bash
    ./SimWorld.sh <MAP_PATH>
    ```

`<MAP_PATH>` refers to the Unreal Engine internal path to a map file (e.g., `/Game/hospital/map/demo.umap`). SimWorld's **base** binary contains 2 city maps and 1 empty map. See [Base Environments](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/base_environments.html) for details. In addition, users can download 100+ **additional environment paks**. See the [Additional Environments](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/additional_environments.html) for the installation and complete list of available map paths. If `<MAP_PATH>` is not specified, the default map (`/Game/Maps/demo_1`) will be open.

<a id="configuration-and-api-reference"></a>
## 📚 Configuration and API Reference

### Configuration

SimWorld uses a YAML configuration file to control **global simulator settings** (e.g., `seed`, `dt`, UE blueprint paths) and **module behaviors** (e.g., city generation, traffic simulation, asset retrieval, and agent/LLM options).

For a comprehensive reference of all configuration parameters, see the [Configuration Reference](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration.html) documentation.

We provide two configuration files to help you get started:
- [simworld/config/default.yaml](simworld/config/default.yaml) contains the **built-in defaults** shipped with the package (reference/fallback). We recommend **not editing** this file.
- [config/example.yaml](config/example.yaml) is a **user template** with placeholders for local paths. Copy it to create your own config.

If you want to customize SimWorld for your own setup, follow the steps below to create and load your own config:

1. Create a custom config from the template:
   ```bash
   cp config/example.yaml config/your_config.yaml
   ```

2. Modify the configuration values in `your_config.yaml` according to your needs.

3. Load your custom configuration in your code:
   ```python
   from simworld.config import Config
   config = Config('path/to/your_config')    # use absolute path here
   ```

### API and Usage

#### Agent Action Space
SimWorld provides a comprehensive action space for pedestrians, vehicles, and robots (e.g., move forward, sit down, pick up). For more details, see [actions](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/agent_system.html#action-space) and [examples/ue_command.ipynb](examples/ue_command.ipynb).

#### Using UE Cameras and Sensors
SimWorld supports a variety of sensors, including RGB images, segmentation maps, and depth images. For more details, please refer to the [sensors](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/ue_detail.html#sensors) and the example script [examples/camera.ipynb](examples/camera.ipynb).

#### Commonly Used APIs
All APIs are located in [simworld/communicator](simworld/communicator). Some of the most commonly used ones are listed below:
- [communicator.get_camera_observation](simworld/communicator/communicator.py#L195) (Get camera images: RGB, depth, or segmentation mask)
- [communicator.spawn_object](simworld/communicator/communicator.py#L574) (Spawn objects in the environment at specified position)
- [communicator.spawn_agent](simworld/communicator/communicator.py#L603) (Spawn agents like humanoids or robots in the environment)
- [communicator.generate_world](simworld/communicator/communicator.py#L812) (Generate procedural city world from configuration)
- [communicator.clear_env](simworld/communicator/communicator.py#L880) (Clear all objects from the environment)

<a id="make-your-simworld"></a>
## 🛠️ Make Your SimWorld

Bring your own Unreal Engine environments, assets, and agent models into SimWorld. This lets you add new maps, objects, and characters beyond the built-in library. For example, you can turn almost any idea into a playable world, such as a rainy campus, a night market, or a sci-fi city, and then drop agents into it to explore, interact, and learn. To import your content into SimWorld, package it as a custom `.pak` file. See full instructions in [Make Your Own Pak Files](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization/make_your_own_pak.html).
